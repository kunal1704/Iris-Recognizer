# Iris-Flower-Recognizer

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to identify three different types of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The project employs a dataset comprising sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species.

<b> Prerequisites </b>
Before embarking on this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Data
The project utilizes the Iris dataset, which is readily available within the scikit-learn library. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each representing an iris flower. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica).

<b> Data Exploration </b>
To gain insights into the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib. This involves examining the distribution of each feature, identifying any potential outliers, and visualizing the relationships between features.

<b> Data Preprocessing </b>
Before training the machine learning model, prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. This ensures that the data is in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

<b> Model Selection and Training </b>
Evaluate various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for classifying the iris species. Train each model using the prepared data and assess its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Random Forest has been used to train the model here.

<b> Model Evaluation </b>
Select the best-performing machine learning model and evaluate its generalization ability using a separate test set. This ensures that the model can accurately classify iris species on unseen data.

<b> Deployment </b>
Once the model is trained and evaluated, consider deploying it into a web application or API to enable users to easily identify iris species based on their measurements.
